################
# Installation #
################

To compile beef, type `make'. If everything goes well, you'll have a file
called `beef' in the current directory -- that is beef's binary.

To install it in the system-wide bin directory, make sure you are root, then
type `make install': this will install the man page and the documentation as
well.

The default prefix is /usr, so beef will be placed in /usr/bin: if you want
beef to be installed in another directory, use
`make install PREFIX=/path/to/dir' -- the man page will be placed in
/usr/share/man/man1 no matter what is the value of PREFIX. The available
documentation will be installed into /usr/share/doc/beef.

If you don't like this setting, then you probably don't like the HFS too, but
you can change them anyway editing the first few lines of the Makefile.

If you are using Debian (or a Debian-based distro such as Ubuntu), you can get
beef from the main archive. Please note the packaged version is probably older
than the current one.

See `man beef' or `beef --help' for more informations on beef's usage. It's
really simple, anyway.
